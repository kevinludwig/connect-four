C4 is an implementation of the board game popularly known as "Connect
Four". <br>

Playing the game<br>
<br>
Players take turns dropping disks into one of seven columns. When a
disk is played, it will drop to the lowest unoccupied row. The goal of
the game is to achieve four connected disks either horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally. When a player achieves three disks in a row,
it is known as a threat.<br>
