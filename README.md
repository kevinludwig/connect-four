### Overview 

A connect four game with configurable search implementations: nega-max, alpha-beta, and nega-scout. The game engine is written in 
c# (`./Engine`) and the user interface is written in VB.NET (`./UI`). I wrote this in the 2005-2006 timeframe, and it sat on a flash drive for several years until I finally dug it up and decided to put it on github.
